- [Pull Request](https://github.com/carlineng/malloy-tpcds/pull/8/files)
- Play with the query and results using the [Fiddle](https://carlineng.github.io/tpcds-fiddle/?q=4+-+Query+04&t=&m=TPC-DS). Unfortunately, the Fiddle uses a downsampled dataset, and Query 4 doesn't return any results on it.

Query 4 is a headscratcher. The motivating business question is only moderately complex, but the SQL implementation is needlessly complicated. The Malloy version is a LOT simpler, but to be fair to SQL, I'm pretty sure I could rewrite the SQL to be much easier to understand.

The query returns a list of customers from 2002 whose year-over-year growth in catalog sales exceeds their year-over-year growth in both either store and web sales. The query unions the `sales` tables from each of catalog, web, and store, and then does a six-way self-join to compute the year-over-year values.

The Malloy model for this query is pretty straightforward. Similar to the approach in query 2, I'm using a SQL Block to construct a Source from a union of the `catalog_sales`, `web_sales` and `store_sales` tables, and joining in the appropriate dimension tables.

The query itself is also quite simple. Rather than doing a six-way self-join like the SQL implementation, I use filtered aggregations to calculate sales for each year, then pipeline the results (using the `->` operator) to divide 2002 sales by 2001 sales.
