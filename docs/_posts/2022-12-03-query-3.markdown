- [Pull Request](https://github.com/carlineng/malloy-tpcds/pull/3/files)
- Play with the query and results using the [Fiddle](https://carlineng.github.io/tpcds-fiddle/?q=3+-+Query+03&m=TPC-DS&t=)

A simple and straightforward query, both in SQL and Malloy. Query 3 asks "which brands have the most gross store sales in November from items with Manufacturer ID 128?" The implementation is two joins and one aggregation.

In the Malloy docs, there's a section entitled [The Tao of Malloy](https://malloydata.github.io/malloy/documentation/tao.html), which describes some of the fundamental principles of the language. The first one is "feels familiar to someone coming from SQL". That certainly rings true here. I think anyone with basic knowledge of SQL would be able to understand what this Malloy query is doing.
