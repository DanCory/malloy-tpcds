This site documents my attempt to re-write the [TPC-DS](https://www.tpc.org/tpcds/) queries using the [Malloy](https://github.com/malloydata/malloy) query language.

TPC-DS is a benchmark consisting of a star-schema dataset and a suite of 99 SQL queries. It is meant to measure the performance of OLAP data warehouses. The queries are of varying complexity, and in total, do a pretty good job of covering the full functionality of most SQL dialects implemented by data warehouse vendors.

Malloy is an experimental query language built by the former founding team of Looker. It combines the concepts of Semantic Modeling and ad-hoc querying, preserves the hierarchical nature of dimensional queries, and refreshes SQL's tired syntax.
